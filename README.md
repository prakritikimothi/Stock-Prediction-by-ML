This is Stock Prediction Project based on Linear Regression which is a Machine Learning algorithm
Stock Prediction Using Linear Regression
Overview
This project is a stock price prediction model that uses Linear Regression, a popular machine learning algorithm, to predict future stock prices based on historical data. The project demonstrates how to preprocess data, build a predictive model, and evaluate its performance using various metrics. This repository is ideal for anyone looking to understand the basics of applying machine learning to financial data.

Introduction
Predicting stock prices is a challenging task due to the inherent volatility and the numerous factors influencing the market. However, by leveraging historical data, it's possible to make educated guesses about future prices. This project uses Linear Regression, a supervised learning algorithm, to build a predictive model that can estimate future stock prices.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares stock data for model training.
Linear Regression Model: Implements a Linear Regression algorithm to predict stock prices.
Evaluation Metrics: Uses metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score to evaluate the model's performance.
Visualization: Includes plots of historical stock prices and predicted vs. actual prices.

Results
Model Performance: The notebook includes evaluation metrics that measure how well the model predicts stock prices.
Visualizations: Line charts that show historical stock prices and the model’s predictions.
